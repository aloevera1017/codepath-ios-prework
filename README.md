## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. TikTok
- The scrolling feature
- Short form videos

2. Instagram
- Reels
- The Notes feature where you can display your thoughts or a song you like

3. Capital One
- When activating a new card, you can put the physical card on the top half of your screen and it automatically activates it in one go.
- Being able to easily see and scroll through all of Capital One's brand partnership deals

App idea: I want to build an app where users can input a screenshot of something they saw a celebrity or influencer wearing and the app can automatically and accurately determine where that piece of clothing is from as well as list dupes of it. This will allow people to dress fashionably but on a budget and demystifies any gatekept information about where famous people buy their clothes. I would love to have the app work like an AI generator and include features similar to ChatGPT but for fashion. I would also like to include features about the carbon footprint of the product and when the best time is to buy the item so that users can get the best discounts and deals.

## Notes

One challenge I faced while building this simple app was getting familarized with all the buttons and features of Xcode because it is unlike any other platform I have worked with before.
